    <description>[h1]Why does this exist if the original works fine?[/h1]
This was originally a quick update to fix the main issue of the mods list being empty when opening the mod menu.

I've been told that the original works now (apparantly some issue was fixed with saves a few hours after mods were enabled). I haven't checked this myself, but you're obviously free to try it, no harm would befall you I don't think.

However, the original won't be updated (see the note at the top of the original mod page), and I decided to make the original fix, and I want to attempt to keep it going (with the help of anyone that wishes to help).
I have not checked for or fixed any other issues that may exist, but I do plan to try and fix issues that may present themselves, as well as add features.
I am still learning BoI modding, so anyone else feel free to issue pull requests, but I'm willing to learn as much as I can.

[h1]Info[/h1]
You may want to unsubscribe from the original before using this. I don't know what would happen if you don't, but I imagine it won't be very nice.

[h1]Navigation[/h1]
[u]Keyboard:[/u]
Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to move around

Esc, backspace, or Q can be used to go back

E, space, or enter can be used to select an item.

By default you can open the menu by pressing L.

F10 will also always open the menu, this cannot be changed.

[u]Controller:[/u]
Both control sticks can be used to move around, press B to go back, A to select an item.

By default you can open the menu by pressing down the right control stick.

[h1]My mods dont work![/h1]
- Make sure you have the latest version of mod config menu, visible in the mod config menu category
- Restart the game!

If you still have issues even after doing all this, please report them to me, and provide any error logs if you have any.

The Mod Config Menu is a mod that adds a new menu to the game that enables other mods to provide a simple and easy way for the player to configure them.

This mod does not do much on its own, to get into the real action you should download a mod which supports this menu.
